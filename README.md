# Gull Code 2019 Problems

Gullcode 2019 problems worked on for fun.

Done in both C++ & Python.

## Problem List


### (1) Knight's Tour

In the game of chess, a knight can move in a very special way. It travels a total of three spaces per move in an 'L' shape fashion. For example, if the knight is in square (1, 1) on an empty standard 8x8 chessboard, it can move it down two and right one (3, 2), or right two and down one. (2, 3). 

Your task is to calculate all series of 64 legal knight moves that result in the knight visiting every square on the chessboard exactly once, when the knight starts from a given coordinate. This is known as the Knight's Tour. The input is the starting row and column (starting at 1) of the knight, the output should be the number of possible paths that the Knight's Tour can follow.

Sample Input:
1 1
Sample Output:
2


### (2) Count Down

Sometimes you ask, "How long until my 21st birthday?" or, "When does Thanksgiving Break start?". Your task is to count down how far away a certain date is from today, Nov. 16th, 2019. Input will be 3 integers consisting of YYYY MM DD, and output should be an integer representing the number of days away it is.

Output is # days from the start date to the end date, but not including the end date.

Sample Input:
2019 11 20
Sample Output:
4
